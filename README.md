# -Image-Classification-for-Archaeological-Sites-using-Pre-trained-Models
This repository aims to classify images of archaeological sites using pre-trained models and deep learning techniques. The dataset includes images from prominent archaeological sites such as Umm Qais, Jerash, Petra, Ajloun Castle, Wadi Rum, and Roman amphitheatres. Data augmentation techniques have been applied to enhance the diversity and robustness of the dataset.

### Steps Taken:

1. **Data Collection and Augmentation:**
   - Images from various archaeological sites were collected and curated for training the models.

   - Data augmentation techniques were applied to increase the variability of the dataset, enhancing model generalization.

2. **Model Architectures:**
   - Several pre-trained models have been utilized for image classification:
     - CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)

4. **Training and Evaluation:**
   - The models were trained on the augmented dataset to learn features and patterns associated with each archaeological site.
  
   - CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
   - **With Augmentation and using CNN model**
